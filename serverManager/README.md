A very, very, very work in progress script for controlling StatusCake, Digital Ocean, and NameCheap via Alexa. Mostly just some messing around with the associated APIs. The script is currently capable of checking on an environment's status using StatusCake, and building a very basic web server using Digital Ocean, NameCheap, and Ansible.

I'll get some more docs up here at some point. For now, this is just a place to store the code while I work on it.
